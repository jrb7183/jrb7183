## About
Hey! I'm Josh, an honors student pursuing the double life of a linguist and a software engineer. I enjoy hiking, baking, and, most of all, conlanging (constructing languages). I am passionate about programming applications for organization, automation, and creativity, especially when they relate to conlanging.
